Psuedocode for hovering

Players should return a buffered image of their tokens,
the images should be put into ImageIcons and they should
be put into a JLabel

JLabel[] playerIcons;

void setUpPlayerIcons() {

	for each player
		playerIcons[i] = new JLabel(new ImageIcon(playerToken));
		add mouse listeners to the JLabels

}

class MouseHandler extends MouseAdapter() {

	@Override
	public void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e) {
		JOption.showMessageDialog(some JFrame, name of player);
	}

	@Override
	public void mouseExited(MouseEvent e) {
		// blah blah
	}
